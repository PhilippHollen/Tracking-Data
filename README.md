# Tracking-Data

Pitch Control Modell

With the help of Laurie Shaw and the Friends of Tacking Tutorials and the datasets provide form Last Row I created Pitch Control Visualizations. 

I also attacked a presentation which was I submitted for the DATA ANALYTICS COMPETITION - 2020 SOUNDERS FC SOCCER ANALYTICS CONFERENCE where I analyzed Liverpool's attack with with tracking data.
